# Deep Space Image Editor with JavaFX

**Project Description:**
The Deep Space Image Editor is a JavaFX application developed for the South East Technological University that takes an image of deep space as input and processes it using the Union-Find algorithm. The primary goal of this project is to identify stars in the image, convert the image to black and white (with stars as white and space as black), and provide options for filtering stars based on their luminance and size. Additionally, the tool can convert each star to a random color to demonstrate the ability of the Union-Find algorithm to recognize individual stars.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the Deep Space Image Editor with JavaFX on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- JavaFX
  
## Features
- **Union-Find Algorithm:** The project utilizes the Union-Find algorithm to identify individual stars in the image.

- **Black and White Conversion:** The tool converts the input image to black and white, with stars appearing as white and space as black.

- **Star Filtering:** Users can filter stars based on luminance (brightness) and size (density in pixels).

- **Random Color Conversion:** Stars can be converted to random colors to showcase the ability of the Union-Find algorithm to recognize each star as an individual entity.
